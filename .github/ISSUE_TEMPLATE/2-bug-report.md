Do the checklist before filing an issue:

 * [ ] Is this related to the `github actions`?
       If you think it's a problem related to Github Actions in general, use GitHub Community forum instead: https://github.community
 * [ ] You've read the Contributing section about bugs reporting: https://github.com/ivankatliarchuk/.github/blob/main/contributing.md
 * [ ] Is this something you can debug and fix? Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
 * [ ] I've searched for similar [issues](../issues) and didn't find any solution

## Description

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## Workflow code

```yaml

```

## Action output

```
